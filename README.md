# parallelR-biostat-2015
Materials for presentation on parallel R to the UC Berkeley biostatistics graduate students, presented by Chris Paciorek, March 2015.

The tutorial material is in parallel.pdf, which is created from a Sweave-based lyx/Latex file (parallel.lyx / parallel.Rnw) using the knitr package in R:

Rscript -e "library(knitr); knit2pdf('parallel.Rnw')"
