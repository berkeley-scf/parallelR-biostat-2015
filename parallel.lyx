How to follow and try out this material
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that my examples here will be silly toy examples for the purpose of
 keeping things simple and focused on the parallelization approaches.
 The demo code embedded in this document is available in the various .R and
 .sh files in the Github repository, 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

target "https://github.com/berkeley-scf/parallelR-biostat-2015"

\end_inset

.
 This document was created using Sweave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will do demos on an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine (VM), on the biostat
 cluster, and on Amazon's AWS.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll use the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "BCE Virtual Machine"
target "bce.berkeley.edu"

\end_inset

.
 You can run this on your laptop (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "the BCE installation instructions"
target "bce.berkeley.edu/install.html"

\end_inset

), and I encourage you to do so to follow along.
 Note: to allow for parallelization, before starting the BCE VM, go to Machine
 > Settings, select System and increase the number of processors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll also use BCE as the basis for the virtual machines we start on Amazon's
 AWS.

\begin_layout Section
Overview of parallel processing computers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two basic flavors of parallel processing (leaving aside GPUs):
 distributed memory and shared memory.
 With shared memory, multiple processors (which I'll call cores) share the
 same memory.
 With distributed memory, you have multiple nodes, each with their own memory.
 You can think of each node as a separate computer connected by a fast network.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Some useful terminology:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
cores
\emph default
: We'll use this term to mean the different processing units available on
 a single node.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
nodes
\emph default
: We'll use this term to mean the different computers, each with their own
 distinct memory, that make up a cluster or supercomputer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
processes
\emph default
: computational tasks executing on a machine.
 A given program may start up multiple processes at once.
 Ideally we have no more processes than cores on a node.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
thread
\emph default
s: multiple paths of execution within a single process; the OS sees the
 threads as a single process, but one can think of them as 'lightweight'
 processes.
 Ideally when considering the processes and their threads, we would have
 no more processes and threads combined than cores on a node.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
forking
\emph default
: child processes are spawned that are identical to the parent, but with
 different process id's and their own memory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
sockets
\emph default
: some of R's parallel functionality involves creating new R processes (e.g.,
 starting processes via 
\emph on
Rscript
\emph default
) and communicating with them via a communication technology called sockets.

\begin_layout Subsection
Shared memory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For shared memory parallelism, each core is accessing the same memory so
 there is no need to pass information (in the form of messages) between
 different machines.
 But in some programming contexts one needs to be careful that activity
 on different cores doesn't mistakenly overwrite places in memory that are
 used by other cores.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shared memory parallelism approaches that we'll cover are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
threaded linear algebra and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
simple parallelization of embarrassingly parallel computations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Threading
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Threads are multiple paths of execution within a single process.
 Using 
\emph on
top
\emph default
 to monitor a job that is executing threaded code, you'll see the process
 using more than 100% of CPU.
 When this occurs, the process is using multiple cores, although it appears
 as a single process rather than as multiple processes.
 In general, threaded code will detect the number of cores available on
 a machine and make use of them.
 However, you can also explicitly control the number of threads available
 to a process.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Distributed memory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parallel programming for distributed memory parallelism requires passing
 messages between the different nodes.
 The standard protocol for doing this is MPI, of which there are various
 versions, including 
\emph on
openMPI
\emph default
.
 The Python package 
\emph on
mpi4py
\emph default
 implements MPI in Python and the R package 
\emph on
Rmpi
\emph default
 implements MPI in R.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the distributed memory approaches that we'll cover are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
simple parallelization of embarrassingly parallel computations,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
using MPI for explicit distributed memory processing, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\begin_layout Subsection
Other type of parallel processing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We won't cover either of the following in this material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
GPUs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are processing units originally designed
 for rendering graphics on a computer quickly.
 This is done by having a large number of simple processing units for massively
 parallel calculation.
 The idea of general purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing is to exploit this capability
 for general computation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In spring 2014, I gave a 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

\end_inset

.
 One easy way to use a GPU is on an Amazon EC2 virtual machine.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Spark and Hadoop
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Spark and Hadoop are systems for implementing computations in a distributed
 memory environment, using the MapReduce approach.
 In fall 2014 I gave a 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

 One easy way to use Spark is on a cluster of Amazon EC2 virtual machines.

\begin_layout Section
Basic suggestions for parallelizing your code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The easiest situation is when your code is embarrassingly parallel, which
 means that the different tasks can be done independently and the results
 collected.
 When the tasks need to interact, things get much harder.
 Much of the material here is focused on embarrassingly parallel computation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following are some basic principles/suggestions for how to parallelize
 your computation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you can do your computation on the cores of a single node using shared
 memory, that will be faster than using the same number of cores (or even
 somewhat more cores) across multiple nodes.
 Similarly, jobs with a lot of data/high memory requirements that one might
 think of as requiring Hadoop may in some cases be much faster if you can
 find a single machine with a lot of memory.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
That said, if you would run out of memory on a single node, then you'll
 need to use distributed memory.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If you have nested loops, you generally only want to parallelize at one
 level of the code.
 That said, there may be cases in which it is helpful to do both.
 Keep in mind whether your linear algebra is being threaded.
 Often you will want to parallelize over a loop and not use threaded linear
 algebra.
 (That said, if you have multiple nodes, you might have one task per node
 and use threaded linear algebra to exploit the cores on each node.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Often it makes sense to parallelize the outer loop when you have nested
 loops.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You generally want to parallelize in such a way that your code is load-balanced
 and does not involve too much communication.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If you have very few tasks, particularly if the tasks take different amounts
 of time, often some processors will be idle and your code poorly load-balanced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you have very many tasks and each one takes little time, the communication
 overhead of starting and stopping the tasks will reduce efficiency.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
I'm happy to help discuss specific circumstances, so just email consult@stat.berk
eley.edu.
 The new Berkeley Research Computing (BRC) initiative is also providing
 consulting on efficient parallelization strategies.
 If my expertise is not sufficient, I can help you get assistance from BRC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Static vs.
 dynamic assignment of tasks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of R's parallel functions allow you to say whether the tasks can be
 divided up and allocated to the workers at the beginning or whether tasks
 should be assigned individually as previous tasks complete.
 E.g., the 
\emph on
mc.preschedule
\emph default
 argument in 
\emph on
mclapply()
\emph default
 and the 
\emph on
.scheduling
\emph default
 argument in 
\emph on
parLapply()
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Basically if you have many tasks that each take similar time, you want to
 preschedule to reduce communication.
 If you have few tasks or tasks with highly variable completion times, you
 don't want to preschedule, to improve load-balancing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Threaded linear algebra and the BLAS 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The BLAS is the library of basic linear algebra operations (written in Fortran
 or C).
 A fast BLAS can greatly speed up linear algebra relative to the default
 BLAS on a machine.
 Some fast BLAS libraries are Intel's 
\emph on
MKL
\emph default
, AMD's 
\emph on
ACML
\emph default
, and the open source (and free) 
\emph on
openBLAS
\emph default
 (formerly 
\emph on
GotoBLAS
\emph default
).
 For the Mac, there is 
\emph on
vecLib
\emph default
 BLAS.
 All of these BLAS libraries are now threaded - if your computer has multiple
 cores and there are free resources, your linear algebra will use multiple
 cores, provided your program is linked against the specific BLAS and provided
 OMP_NUM_THREADS is not set to one.
 (Macs make use of VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS rather than OMP_NUM_THREADS.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fixing the number of threads (cores used)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, if you want to limit the number of threads used, you can set
 the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable on UNIX machine.
 This can be used in the context of R or C code that uses BLAS or your own
 threaded C code, but this does not work with Matlab.
 In the UNIX shell, you'd do this as follows (e.g.
 to limit to 3 cores):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=3 # bash
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 3 # tcsh
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are running R, you'd need to do this in your shell session before
 invoking R.

\begin_layout Subsection
Using threading in R
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Threading in R is limited to linear algebra, for which R calls external
 BLAS and LAPACK libraries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's some code that when run in an R executable linked to a threaded BLAS
 illustrates the speed of using a threaded BLAS:

\begin_layout Chunk

<<RlinAlg, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

@
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The R installation manual gives information on how to link R to a fast BLAS.
 On Ubuntu Linux, if you install openBLAS as follows, the 
\emph on
/etc/alternatives
\emph default
 system will set 
\emph on
/usr/lib/libblas.so
\emph default
 to point to openBLAS.
 By default on Ubuntu, R will use the system BLAS, so it will as a result
 use openBLAS.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

<<etc-alternatives, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'>>=

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Important warnings about use of threaded BLAS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Conflict between openBLAS and some parallel functionality in R
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are conflicts between forking in R and threaded BLAS that in some
 cases affect 
\emph on
foreach
\emph default
 (when using the 
\emph on
multicore
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
parallel
\emph default
 backends), 
\emph on
mclapply()
\emph default
, and (only if 
\emph on
cluster()
\emph default
 is set up with forking (not the default)) 
\emph on
par{L,S,}apply()
\emph default
.
 The result is that if linear algebra is used within your parallel code,
 R hangs.
 This affects (under somewhat different circumstances) both ACML and openBLAS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To address this, before running an R job that does linear algebra, you can
 set OMP_NUM_THREADS to 1 to prevent the BLAS from doing threaded calculations.
 Alternatively, you can use MPI as the parallel backend (via 
\emph on
doMPI
\emph default
 in place of 
\emph on
doMC
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
doParallel
\emph default
 -- see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Distributed-memory"

\end_inset

).
 You may also be able to convert your code to use 
\emph on
par{L,S,}apply() 
\emph default
[with the default PSOCK type] and avoid 
\emph on
foreach
\emph default
 entirely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Conflict between threaded BLAS and R profiling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also a conflict between threaded BLAS and R profiling, so if you
 are using 
\emph on
Rprof()
\emph default
, you may need to set OMP_NUM_THREADS to one.
 This has definitely occurred with openBLAS; I'm not sure about other threaded
 BLAS libraries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Speed and threaded BLAS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many cases, using multiple threads for linear algebra operations will
 outperform using a single thread, but there is no guarantee that this will
 be the case, in particular for operations with small matrices and vectors.
 Testing with openBLAS suggests that sometimes a job may take more time
 when using multiple threads; this seems to be less likely with ACML.
 This presumably occurs because openBLAS is not doing a good job in detecting
 when the overhead of threading outweights the gains from distributing the
 computations.
 You can compare speeds by setting OMP_NUM_THREADS to different values.
 In cases where threaded linear algebra is slower than unthreaded, you would
 want to set OMP_NUM_THREADS to 1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore I recommend that you test any large jobs to compare performance
 with a single thread vs.
 multiple threads.
 Only if you see a substantive improvement with multiple threads does it
 make sense to have OMP_NUM_THREADS be greater than one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Basic shared memory parallel programming in R
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
foreach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A simple way to exploit parallelism in R when you have an embarrassingly
 parallel problem (one where you can split the problem up into independent
 chunks) is to use the 
\emph on
foreach
\emph default
 package to do a for loop in parallel.
 For example, bootstrapping, random forests, simulation studies, cross-validatio
n and many other statistical methods can be handled in this way.
 You would not want to use 
\emph on
foreach
\emph default
 if the iterations were not independent of each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
foreach
\emph default
 package provides a 
\emph on
foreach
\emph default
 command that allows you to do this easily.
 
\emph on
foreach
\emph default
 can use a variety of parallel

 It can use

\end_inset

 or the 
\emph on
parallel
\emph default
 or 
\emph on

 packages to use shared memory cores.
 When using 
\emph on
parallel
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
multicore
\emph default
 as the back-end, you should see multiple processes (as many as you registered;
 ideally each at 100%) when you look at 
\emph on
top
\emph default
.
 The multiple processes are created by forking or using sockets; this is
 discussed a bit more later in this document.

\emph default
 also provides some additional functionality for collecting and managing
 the results that mean that you don't have to do some of the bookkeeping
 you would need to do if writing your own for loop.

\begin_layout Standard
A caution concerning 
\emph on
Rmpi/doMPI
\emph default
: when you invoke 
\emph on
startMPIcluster()
\emph default
, all the slave R processes become 100% active and stay active until the
 cluster is closed.
 In addition, when 
\emph on
foreach
\emph default
 is actually running, the master process also becomes 100% active.
 So using this functionality involves some inefficiency in CPU usage.
 This inefficiency is not seen with a sockets cluster (see next) nor when
 using other 
\emph on
Rmpi
\emph default
 functionality - i.e., starting slaves with 
\emph on
mpi.spawn.Rslaves()
\emph default
 and then issuing commands to the slaves.

MPI basics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are multiple MPI implementations, of which 
\emph on
openMPI
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
mpich
\emph default
 are very common.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In MPI programming, the same code runs on all the machines.
 This is called SPMD (single program, multiple data).
 As we saw above, one invokes the same code (same program) multiple times,
 but the behavior of the code can be different based on querying the rank
 (ID) of the process.
 Since MPI operates in a distributed fashion, any transfer of information
 between processes must be done explicitly via send and receive calls (e.g.,
 
\emph on
MPI_Send
\emph default
, 
\emph on
MPI_Recv
\emph default
, 
\emph on
MPI_Isend
\emph default
, and 
\emph on
MPI_Irecv
\emph default
).
 (The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

MPI_
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is for C code; C++ just has 
\emph on
Send
\emph default
, 
\emph on
Recv
\emph default
, etc.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The latter two of these functions (
\emph on
MPI_Isend
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
MPI_Irecv
\emph default
) are so-called non-blocking calls.
 One important concept to understand is the difference between blocking
 and non-blocking calls.
 Blocking calls wait until the call finishes, while non-blocking calls return
 and allow the code to continue.
 Non-blocking calls can be more efficient, but can lead to problems with
 synchronization between processes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to send and receive calls to transfer to and from specific processes
, there are calls that send out data to all processes (
\emph on
MPI_Scatter
\emph default
), gather data back (
\emph on
MPI_Gather
\emph default
) and perform reduction operations (
\emph on
MPI_Reduce
\emph default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Debugging MPI/
\emph on
Rmpi
\emph default
 code can be tricky because communication can hang, error messages from
 the workers may not be seen or readily accessible and it can be difficult
 to assess the state of the worker processes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First let's get a feel for MPI in the simple context of a single node.
 Of course it's a bit silly to do this in reality on a single node on which
 one can take advantage of shared memory.
 There's not much reason to use MPI on a single node as there's a cost to
 the message passing relative to shared memory, but it is useful to be able
 to test the code on a single machine without having to worry about networking
 issues across nodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Using Rmpi to write code for distributed computation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
R users can use 
\emph on
Rmpi
\emph default
 to interface with MPI.
 To use 
\emph on
Rmpi
\emph default
, you can simply start R as you normally do by invoking a command-line R
 session or using R CMD BATCH.
 To use Rmpi across multiple nodes you'll need to invoke R with mpirun as
 in the example of foreach with doMPI on multiple nodes above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's some example code that uses actual 
\emph on
Rmpi
\emph default
 syntax (as opposed to 
\emph on
foreach
\emph default
 with Rmpi as the back-end).
 This code runs in a master-slave paradigm where the master starts the slaves
 and invokes commands on them.
 It may be possible to run 
\emph on
Rmpi
\emph default
 in a context where each process runs the same code based on invoking with
 Rmpi, but I haven't investigated this further.

CAUTION: for some reason this syntax is not distributing workers to the

 but it should work on the Biostat cluster.
 This has worked in the past for me, so I'm not sure what is going on, but
 it may be a difference in the MPI version or something in the latest Ubuntu
 (Ubuntu 14 vs.
 Ubuntu 12).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that if you do this in interactive mode, some of the usual functionality
 of command line R (tab completion, scrolling for history) is not enabled

Here are a few high-level principles:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Write vectorized code, not for loops or apply-style statements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Pre-allocate storage rather than allocating into a position in a vector
 or list that is beyond the length of that vector/list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Make sure R is linked to a fast BLAS.

\begin_layout Subsection
Benchmarking and profiling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again my class notes (see above link) provide more details on the topics
 below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system.time() function allows you to time R code.
 The rbenchmark package provides a nice wrapper function, benchmark(), that
 eases timing of code and comparison of timing of different code chunks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Rprof() function allows you to see how much time is spent in different
 parts of your code, helping to identify bottlenecks.
 Rprof() works as follows.
 At set time intervals, it queries the R process to see what function is
 being evaluated and writes this info to disk.
 Then when the code is finished you can call summaryRprof() to collect those
 statistics.
 Note that if your code runs very quickly, you may not get enough queries
 accumulated to have useful information.
 See the 'interval' argument to Rprof.
 In this case you may be able to write a loop that repeatedly evaluates
 your code.

\begin_layout Standard
The key thing when thinking about random numbers in a parallel context is
 that you want to avoid having the same 'random' numbers occur on multiple
 processes.
 On a computer, random numbers are not actually random but are generated
 as a sequence of pseudo-random numbers designed to mimic true random numbers.
 The sequence is finite (but very long) and eventually repeats itself.
 When one sets a seed, one is choosing a position in that sequence to start
 from.
 Subsequent random numbers are based on that subsequence.
 All random numbers can be generated from one or more random uniform numbers,
 so we can just think about a sequence of values between 0 and 1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The worst thing that could happen is that one sets things up in such a way
 that every process is using the same sequence of random numbers.
 This could happen if you mistakenly set the same seed in each process,
 e.g., using 
\emph on
set.seed(mySeed)
\emph default
 in R on every process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The naive approach is to use a different seed for each process.
 E.g., if your processes are numbered 
\begin_inset Formula $id=1,\ldots,p$
\end_inset

, with 
\emph on
id
\emph default
 unique to a process, using 
\emph on
set.seed(id)
\emph default
 on each process.
 This is likely not to cause problems, but raises the danger that two (or
 more sequences) might overlap.
 For an algorithm with dependence on the full sequence, such as an MCMC,
 this probably won't cause big problems (though you likely wouldn't know
 if it did), but for something like simple simulation studies, some of your
 'independent' samples could be exact replicates of a sample on another
 process.
 Given the period length of the default generators in R, Matlab and Python,
 this is actually quite unlikely, but it is a bit sloppy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One approach to avoid the problem is to do all your RNG on one process and
 distribute the random deviates, but this can be infeasible with many random
 numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More generally to avoid this problem, the key is to use an algorithm that
 ensures sequences that do not overlap.

Ensuring separate sequences in R
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In R, there are two packages that deal with this, 
\emph on
rlecuyer
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
rsprng
\emph default
.
 We'll go over 
\emph on
rlecuyer
\emph default
, as I've heard that 
\emph on
rsprng
\emph default
 is deprecated (though there is no evidence of this on CRAN) and 
\emph on
rsprng
\emph default
 is (at the moment) not available for the Mac.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The L'Ecuyer algorithm has a period of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{191}$
\end_inset

, which it divides into subsequences of length 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{127}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
With the parallel package
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's how you initialize independent sequences on different processes when
 using the 
\emph on
parallel
\emph default
 package's parallel apply functionality (illustrated here with 
\emph on
parSapply()
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

<<RNG-apply, eval=FALSE>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

@
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to explicitly move from stream to stream, you can use 
\emph on
nextRNGStream()
\emph default
.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

<<RNGstream, eval=FALSE>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

@
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using 
\emph on
mclapply()
\emph default
, you can use the 
\emph on
mc.set.seed
\emph default
 argument as follows (note that 
\emph on
mc.set.seed
\emph default
 is TRUE by default, so you should get different seeds for the different
 processes by default), but one needs to invoke 
\family typewriter
RNGkind("L'Ecuyer-CMRG")
\family default
 to get independent streams via the L'Ecuyer algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

<<RNG-mclapply, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE>>=

\begin_layout Standard
The documentation for 
\emph on
mcparallel()
\emph default
 gives more information about reproducibility based on 
\emph on
mc.set.seed
\emph default
.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
With foreach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Getting independent streams
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One question is whether 
\emph on
foreach
\emph default
 deals with RNG correctly.
 This is not documented, but the developers (Revolution Analytics) are well
 aware of RNG issues.
 Digging into the underlying code reveals that the 
\emph on
doMC
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
doParallel
\emph default
 backends both invoke 
\emph on
mclapply()
\emph default
 and set 
\emph on
mc.set.seed
\emph default
 to TRUE by default.
 This suggests that the discussion above r.e.
 
\emph on
mclapply()
\emph default
 holds for 
\emph on
foreach
\emph default
 as well, so you should do 
\family typewriter
RNGkind("L'Ecuyer-CMRG")
\family default
 before your foreach call.
 For 
\emph on
doMPI
\emph default
, as of version 0.2, you can do something like this, which uses L'Ecuyer
 behind the scenes:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
cl <- makeCluster(nSlots)
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

setRngDoMPI(cl, seed=0)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Ensuring reproducibility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While using 
\emph on
foreach
\emph default
 as just described should ensure that the streams on each worker are are
 distinct, it does not ensure reproducibility because task chunks may be
 assigned to workers differently in different runs and the substreams are
 specific to workers, not to tasks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For 
\emph on
doMPI
\emph default
, you can specify a different RNG substream for each task chunk in a way
 that ensures reproducibility.
 Basically you provide a list called 
\emph on
.options.mpi
\emph default
 as an argument to 
\emph on
foreach
\emph default
, with 
\emph on
seed
\emph default
 as an element of the list:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

<<RNG-doMPI, eval=TRUE>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

@
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That single seed then initializes the RNG for the first task, and subsequent
 tasks get separate substreams, using the L'Ecuyer algorithm, based on 
\emph on
nextRNGStream()
\emph default
.
 Note that the 
\emph on
doMPI
\emph default
 developers also suggest using the 
\emph on
chunkSize
\emph default
 option (also specified as an element of 
\emph on
.options.mpi
\emph default
) when using 
\emph on
seed
\emph default
.

\begin_layout Standard
For other backends, such as 
\emph on
doParallel
\emph default
, there is a package called 
\emph on
doRNG
\emph default
 that ensures that 
\emph on
foreach
\emph default
 loops are reproducible.
 Here's how you do it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

<<RNG-doRNG>>=

\begin_layout Chunk

Alternatively, you can do:

<<RNG-doRNG2>>=
